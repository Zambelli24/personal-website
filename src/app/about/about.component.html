<h3>Who the heck am I?</h3>
<p>I am a problem solver, life liver, and go getter. I find great satisfaction in finding the most effective solution to any challenge. You will find that I am driven, well organized, and extremely effective. I have learned a variety of skills from my experience as an athlete, collegiate football player, professional and adventurer. When I'm not working, I love to exercise and compete. I am a passionate golfer. I enjoy hiking, skiing, lifting and running. I am reader, painter and a student of life. Every day is an opportunity to develop myself as a human and grow into a better man than the day before.</p>
